\section{Pythagorean Theorem}

\fixnote{Add a first problem about stating the Pythagorean Theorem.  Teaching notes about stating hypotheses and about introducing the converse.  Perhaps include an example of a true statement with a false converse (e.g., vertical angles, 4 and even).  Right picture looks like the distributive property.  Perhaps add a problem about the history involving Egyptians, ropes, knots, and right angles.  Ask whether it is about the theorem or the converse.  Also, see e-mail.} 

\begin{prob}
Give two explanations of how the following picture ``proves''
  the Pythagorean Theorem, one using algebra and one without algebra.\standard{8.G.6}
